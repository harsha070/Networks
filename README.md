Networks Notes

## Computer architectures are layered to simplify design and implementation

- L1 Physical Layer: Transfers bits across a link like Ethernet, Modem 
- L2 Data link layer: 

Time required to transmit a message depends on number of bits in image and how fast network can transfer. Information in blocks like images, text are measured in bits while information in streams like voice/video calls are measured in bits-per-second
